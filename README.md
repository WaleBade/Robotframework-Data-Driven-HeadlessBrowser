# Robotframework Data-Driven Headless Browser Login Test

This repository contains an automated login test project I created using Robot Framework, Selenium Library, Faker Library, and a headless browser. The test is data-driven, meaning it uses external data to drive the testing process, ensuring thorough validation of the login functionality.

## Features

- **Robot Framework**: I used Robot Framework as the testing framework for its simplicity and scalability.
- **Selenium Library**: I integrated Selenium Library to interact with web elements and perform browser automation.
- **Faker Library**: Faker was used to generate random test data dynamically, including user credentials.
- **Headless Browser**: I executed tests in a headless mode to speed up execution and enable running tests in CI/CD pipelines without requiring a graphical environment.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Login tests are driven by external data sources, allowing for testing with multiple sets of credentials.

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: I set up the Robot Framework environment and installed the required libraries using pip. This includes the Selenium Library and Faker Library.
2. **Test Case**: The login test case verifies that the system handles both valid and invalid login attempts correctly. It uses dynamic data generated by Faker for testing.
3. **Data Source**: Test data is stored in an external file (e.g., CSV or Excel) and loaded during test execution.
4. **Headless Execution**: Tests run in a headless browser environment, ensuring fast and resource-efficient execution.

## Repository Structure

- `tests/`: Contains the test cases written in Robot Framework syntax. The primary test automation file is `LoginTest.robot`.
- `resources/`: Includes resource files with reusable variables and keywords:
  - `Project_Variables.resource`: Contains variable definitions.
  - `Project_Keywords.resource`: Contains custom keywords used in the tests..
- `log/`: Stores test execution reports and logs.

## Prerequisites

To run the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or later)
- Robot Framework
- Selenium Library
- Faker Library
- Browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WaleBade/Robotframework-Data-Driven-HeadlessBrowser.git
   cd Robotframework-Data-Driven-HeadlessBrowser
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   robot -d results/ tests/
   ```

## Results

After running the tests, you can find the logs and reports in the `results/` directory. Open the `report.html` file to view detailed test execution results.
